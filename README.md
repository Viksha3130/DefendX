# DefendX
DefendX is an advanced Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that offers comprehensive monitoring and protection against various cyber threats, including DDoS attacks, unauthorized USB device insertions, and file content modifications. It is designed to safeguard network integrity and data integrity by continuously analyzing network traffic, device interactions, and file system activities in real-time. 

## Key Features
### DDoS Attack Monitoring: 
DefendX employs sophisticated algorithms to detect and mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. By monitoring network traffic patterns and behavior, DefendX can identify abnormal spikes in traffic indicative of DDoS attacks. Upon detection, it automatically triggers mitigation measures to prevent service disruptions and maintain network availability.

### USB Device Detection: 
DefendX includes USB device monitoring functionality to detect and manage USB device insertions within the network environment. It tracks USB device events across endpoints and identifies unauthorized or suspicious devices being connected. DefendX helps prevent data breaches and malware infections that may result from unauthorized USB device usage.

### File Integrity Monitoring: 
DefendX offers robust file integrity monitoring capabilities to detect unauthorized modifications to file content. It continuously monitors file attributes, checksums, and content changes to identify any alterations that may indicate a security breach or compromise. DefendX alerts administrators promptly upon detecting file modifications, allowing them to investigate and respond to potential threats effectively.

## Usage

### Network Monitoring: 
DefendX provides administrators with a centralized dashboard to monitor real-time network traffic. Through visualizations and alerts, potential DDoS attacks and other suspicious activities can be promptly identified and addressed.

### Endpoint Security: 
DefendX deploys IDS agents on endpoints to continuously monitor USB device insertions and file system activities. This ensures comprehensive endpoint security coverage, mitigating risks associated with unauthorized access and malware infections.

### Alerting and Response: 
DefendX generates alerts and notifications upon detecting suspicious activities, enabling administrators to investigate and respond promptly to potential security incidents. This proactive approach helps minimize the impact of security breaches on network integrity and data confidentiality.
